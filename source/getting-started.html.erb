        <p>Find out what MoJ Forms can do and how you can get started creating your own forms and services.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting access and logging in</h2>
        <p>MoJ Forms is at <a href="https://moj-forms-editor.service.justice.gov.uk/">https://moj-forms-editor.service.justice.gov.uk/</a>.</p> 
        <p>To get access, <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
        <p>You will need an email address ending in either:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>@digital.justice.gov.uk</li>
        <li>@justice.gov.uk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>MoJ Forms shares a login with your primary work email address so you don't need to remember a separate username or password."
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Planning your first form</h2>
        <p>Weâ€™ve designed MoJ Forms to be quick and easy to use but it helps to plan out your form in advance. For help with this, read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure">Service Manual chapter on structuring forms</a>.</p>
        <p>You should also refer to the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">Design System</a> for advice and guidance on putting the various form components and patterns to use.</p>
